abstract = {Object-Oriented Design with Applications has long been the essential reference to object-oriented technology, which, in turn, has evolved to join the mainstream of industrial-strength software development. In this third edition--the first revision in 13 years--readers can learn to apply object-oriented methods using new paradigms such as Java, the Unified Modeling Language (UML) 2.0, and .NET.The authors draw upon their rich and varied experience to offer improved methods for object development and numerous examples that tackle the complex problems faced by software engineers, including systems architecture, data acquisition, cryptoanalysis, control systems, and Web development. They illustrate essential concepts, explain the method, and show successful applications in a variety of fields. You'll also find pragmatic advice on a host of issues, including classification, implementation strategies, and cost-effective project management.New to this new edition are An introduction to the new UML 2.0, from the notation's most fundamental and advanced elements with an emphasis on key changes New domains and contexts A greatly enhanced focus on modeling--as eagerly requested by readers--with five chapters that each delve into one phase of the overall development lifecycle. Fresh approaches to reasoning about complex systems An examination of the conceptual foundation of the widely misunderstood fundamental elements of the object model, such as abstraction, encapsulation, modularity, and hierarchy How to allocate the resources of a team of developers and mange the risks associated with developing complex software systems An appendix on object-oriented programming languagesThis is the seminal text for anyone who wishes to use object-oriented technology to manage the complexity inherent in many kinds of systems.Sidebars\"{\i} \"{\i} Preface\"{\i} Acknowledgments \"{\i} \"{\i} About the Authors \"{\i} \"{\i} Section I: Concepts\"{\i} \"{\i} Chapter 1: Complexity\"{\i} \"{\i} \"{\i} Chapter 2: The Object Model \"{\i} \"{\i} Chapter 3: Classes and Objects \"{\i} \"{\i} Chapter 4: Classification \"{\i} \"{\i} Section II: Method \"{\i} Chapter 5: Notation \"{\i} \"{\i} Chapter 6: Process Chapter 7: Pragmatics\"{\i} \"{\i} \"{\i} Chapter 8: System Architecture: Satellite-Based Navigation \"{\i} \"{\i} Chapter 9: Control System: Traffic Management \"{\i} \"{\i} Chapter 10: Artificial Intelligence: Cryptanalysis \"{\i} \"{\i} Chapter 11: Data Acquisition: Weather Monitoring Station \"{\i} Chapter 12: Web Application: Vacation Tracking System \"{\i} \"{\i} \"{\i} Appendix A: Object-Oriented Programming Languages\"{\i} Appendix B: Further Reading \"{\i} \"{\i} Notes \"{\i} \"{\i} Glossary \"{\i} \"{\i} Classified Bibliography \"{\i} \"{\i} Index \"{\i} \"{\i}}

publisher = {Springer Publishing Company, Incorporated},
edition = {1st},
abstract = {This textbook provides an in-depth introduction to software design, with a focus on object-oriented design, and using the Java programming language. Its goal is to help readers learn software design by discovering the experience of the design process. To this end, a narrative is used that introduces each element of design know-how in context, and explores alternative solutions in that context. The narrative is supported by hundreds of code fragments and design diagrams. The first chapter is a general introduction to software design. The subsequent chapters cover design concepts and techniques, which are presented as a continuous narrative anchored in specific design problems. The design concepts and techniques covered include effective use of types and interfaces, encapsulation, composition, inheritance, design patterns, unit testing, and many more. A major emphasis is placed on coding and experimentation as a necessary complement to reading the text. To support this aspect of the learning process, a companion website with practice problems is provided, and three sample applications that capture numerous design decisions are included. Guidance on these sample applications is provided in a section called "Code Exploration" at the end of each chapter. Although the Java language is used as a means of conveying design-related ideas, the book's main goal is to address concepts and techniques that are applicable in a host of technologies. This book is intended for readers who have a minimum of programming experience and want to move from writing small programs and scripts to tackling the development of larger systems. This audience naturally includes students in university-level computer science and software engineering programs. As the prerequisites to specific computing concepts are kept to a minimum, the content is also accessible to programmers without a primary training in computing. In a similar vein, understanding the code fragments requires only a minimal grasp of the language, such as would be taught in an introductory programming course.}
