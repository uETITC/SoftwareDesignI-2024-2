## Exams

[First](./Lessons/Exams/First.md)

[Second](./Lessons/Exams/Second.md)

## Objective 

To enable students to understand and apply the fundamental principles of software design in application development. This includes software modeling, the use of constraint diagrams, and the application of good design practices using appropriate tools and technologies.

## Subject Learning Results (RAC)

At the end of the course the student will be able to:

**RAC 1.** Explain the fundamental principles of software design and their importance in application development.

**RAC 2.** Apply good design practices to the development of software applications, using UML diagrams to represent design principles.

**RAC 3.** Use appropriate tools and technologies for software design, representing models of applications to be developed and comparing design applications to determine their performance, ease of use, and level of upgradability.

For all periods the grade is divided into: Co-evaluation (10 %), self-evaluation (10 %), and teacher evaluation (80 %) which is divided into exams (50 %) and assignments (30 %). The first and second periods are 35 % of the final grade, while for the last period it is 30 %. In the first and second periods the exam consists of two tests: one practical (40 %) and the other theoretical (60 %).
